                <h2>Kriegsspiel - A Thesis Proposal of Conflict Simulation through Complex Systems</h2>
                <p>Wargaming has a long and important history of cultural impact in this world. Stemming from the 18th Century, wargaming has been employed by many nations for leadership training and conflict simulation as well as historical education and recreation. By applying the concepts of systems and game theory in the context of conflict simulation, I seek to delve into the various complications of creating a ruleset that tackles the various challenges and problems that arise from abstracting real life scenarios into realistic but fun simulations. The goal of simulating reality for these applications would be to recreate historical or hypothetical situations for learning, competitive, and casual purposes; broken down in ways that are of better understanding. By delving into and creating these systems, for my degree project I hope to produce a playable system that will be realistic, fun, and easy to understand and acquire.</p>

                        <h2>What are Wargames</h2>
                        <p>Wargames came into general existence in the late 18th century, under the name of Kriegsspiel in the Prussian armies. As time went on and the games became more realistic, it started to become a commonplace training item for Prussian leaders. It is widely believed that these wargames are one of the big reasons that led to Prussian dominance over France in the 2nd Franco-Prussian war.</p>
                        <p>Today they are still used in a multitude of reasons, including the continued use of simulation and training with military leaders. Militaries of numerous nations today use wargames in all sorts of scales: single person, teams pitted against each other, or even full scale wargames such as Able Archer which almost started World War III in 1983.</p>
                        <p>However, beyond military use, they are also heavily used for purposes of entertainment and education. Sometimes wargamers just want to play out the events of the Normandy beach landings casually, or sometimes people use wargames competitively in tournaments. Maybe someone wants to learn about Operation Market Garden, by playing a wargame about it, they would learn about the massive and failed airdrop operation of Allied forces in World War II.</p>

                        <h2>Computer Wargames</h2>
                        <p>A few years back, I had started playing computer wargames. Games like Combat Mission, Close Combat, WinSPMBT/WinSPWW2, Panzer General/Panzer Corps, Achtung Panzer, Graviteam Tactics, Steel Armor Beasts of War, Steel Beasts, DCS, ARMA, the list just goes on and on. This in combination with the idea of playing extremely complex game systems from more years prior, like Dwarf Fortress, and a love of military history I started really getting into the idea of playing out complex systems based on realistic data and statistics to sort of recreate epic battle scenes like some sort of war movie.</p>

                        <h2>Traditional Wargames</h2>
                        <p>This eventually led to digging into traditional wargames from the 70-90's. Game companies like Avalon Hill, SPI/S&T, GMT, and others have created insanely wide ranges of games covering any sort of era or scale throughout war history, be it strategic scale controlling entire dynasties in feudal Japan, or managing the entire logistical line of supplies on the eastern front of World War II, or whether it's tactical scale engagements, controlling single soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam, and everything in between.</p>

                    <h2>The Ultimate Wargame</h2>
                    <p>Of course a line like that drew me towards the wargame, Advanced Squad Leader. As someone with a lot of interest in war history, World War II is arguably the most interesting and probably biggest out of any other war in terms of size and information. I had heard stories about this game from a few people in some places, basically hearing about the insanity of detail which of course drew me in more.</p>
                    <h2>I Wasn't Ready</h2>
                    <p>This game had been out since 1985 and had spawned so many expansion modules, historical scenario modules, bonus action packs, as well as numerous third party companies creating all sorts of sets of various things for the game. To say the least, getting into the game now, has you way behind. Every component is incredibly expensive, almost every component requires you to own a prior dependent and at least half of the modules across the board are out of print, and have been for at least five years. If you merely wanted to play Pacific Theatre scenarios, you would need to spend around $400-$500 but good luck even being able to find all the pieces needed anyways.</p>
                    <p>The rules were indeed complex as well, considering the base rulebook itself ran around 350 pages, with 4 core chapters, each about 70 pages long explaining a different chunk of the game. For example, the first chapter, Chapter A, covers the base game rules, and Infantry rules. 70 pages of extremely dense reading and you can't even use support guns, ordnance, or vehicles of any kind yet.</p>
                    <h2>Grognards, Audience of</h2>
                    <p>A grognard is someone who would be considered an ultra-hardcore wargamer. They like to play some of the most complex systems out there, some of them taking months of reading and learning just to start playing the game with the simplest mechanics, never mind moving on to more advanced techniques. <strong>Someone once also told me as a joke that a grognard was a type of game where you spent more time looking at the rulebook while playing, than playing the game itself.</strong> This can be true of most of these games, but there’s just something in this niche of wargames that really appeal to this group of people. They like data-density, they love complicated mechanics, and they love having every possible degree of detail being present in a system. They don’t want simple binary results like yes/no, they want fifty possible variations of yes and no.</p>

            <img src="img/aslboard.png" alt="Advanced Squad Leader Scenario Play">
            <h6>ASL is also incredibly complex, despite being at a "smaller" tactical scale. The game has an entire page or two devoted just to the mechanics of flammability of terrain types, how fires spread, how wind speed and direction affect them, and how and where smoke drifts according to such, as well as how thick the smoke is at any given turn.</h6>

            <h6>A handful of my scrawlings for different game systems, mostly 1033 and Voroshilov.</h6>
            <p>I decided that with all of these problems, that I would rather just make my own game. The system employed by MMP in their control of ASL actually frustrated me so much that I wanted something done, and it would be better to do it myself.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Project Potato Mashers</h2>
                <p>Like Advanced Squad Leader, the first idea I gravitated towards was to create a company scale, World War II, tactical game. I started building influences and working on what sort of mechanics and systems to add to my game, and then I finally managed to play a couple games of ASL. ASL turned out to be one of the most fun games I have ever played in my life, and I realized that it really was the ultimate wargame. For me to make my own system, would be counter productive because one, I wouldn't want to play it, if ASL was really that much better, and two, I also found out there are hundreds of other similar systems already out there, some of them already derivative from ASL. This idea was quickly scrapped, though all the notes still exist just in case.</p>
                <h2>Project 1033</h2>
                <p>Project 1033 was my next main idea where I was likened to the idea of building a small scale tactical game about the conflicts between say barricaded suspects and SWAT teams. This eventually evolved to cover more than just simple criminals and police, but ideally any sort of BLUFOR v. REDFOR situation, SWAT breaking apart bank heists, South American secret police invading banana republic dictator houses, etc. A lot of notes, ideas, and mechanics were put together for this game, more than Potato Mashers, but I feared the scope of the game and what I could currently do wouldn't cut it, so I started looking elsewhere.</p>
                <h2>Project Voroshilov</h2>
                <p>I finally managed to see the movie, Fury, and it really put the idea into my head of something along the lines of "Why on earth is there not already a game like this?". Well it eventually turned out Avalon Hill did make a game with the same sort of inner-crew focus and single tank premise that the movie followed called "Patton's Best", but at the time I wasn't aware and couldn't find it at all. I started building out this game, and this is what became Knocked Out.</p>

            <h6>Stylized image of a Soviet T-34/76 with "Rodina" or Motherland on it's turret.</h6>
            <p>After solidifying my idea, the next objective was to build out as much as the game prototype as I possibly could with these key traits.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Narrative Generation</h2>
                <p>Some of the games I have played feature a lot of random/procedural generation as well as narrative creating mechanics. These sorts of things tended to pull in a lot of outside interest, as even those not interested in playing the game itself for whatever reasons, were very if not more interested in the stories that came out of the game. Thus I wanted this to be a game in the same vein as I found those sorts of systems to be very interesting. Instead of getting a bunch of unlucky rolls and going, "Well I just suck today.", you could now look at the rolls, the situation, and any other context and begin to piece together a story to be told after the game was done being played. A platoon of Russian tankers all roll horribly, well maybe there's a story element of them all being fresh conscripts now.</p>
                <h2>Chaos</h2>
                <p>A large portion of the game had to be randomly determined by dice rolls. This would create the maximum amount of unique runs for each and every single play through despite how similar the setup was. A slightly different roll in one spot could drastically alter the outcome of the entire run.</p>
                <h2>Complex Detail</h2>
                <p>The system also had to produce at least some of the details in complexity of warfare. I had been far more interested in games that didn't just give simple, "Dead" or "Okay" results. I wanted more systems where an incoming shell didn't just destroy a tank or not, but rather explain that the shell pierced the frontal hull through the driver's vision slit, ripped the driver apart, smashed the engine, bounced back and hit an ammo rack which exploded the entire tank.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Easy to Obtain</h2>
                <p>Unlike ASL and numerous other systems already out there, I wanted this to be very easy and cheap to obtain. Simple print and play sheets to play would be all that was needed, with easily accessible rules online or for print as well. If the system ever ends up reaching a point of being sell-able, it would be extremely cheap and by not depending on official publisher/printers but rather buyer printing, theres no risk of it ever running out of print.</p>
                <h2>Balance of Understanding</h2>
                <p>While I wanted an extreme amount of complex details, it also had to be easier to understand to less serious gamers who were interested, and also ease new players into the system instead of suddenly dropping 600 pages of rules onto them and/or greatly bogging the system down with a million checks. The complexity v. accessibility struggle was probably the most active in terms of balancing the system as it stands so far.</p>

                <h1>The System Basis</h1>
                <img src="img/KnockedOutT34.png" alt="Knocked Out Background">
                <h6>Stylized image of a knocked out T-34/76.</h6>
                <h2>Knocked Out - A Game of Fighting Armored Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Knocked Out is a generative, traditional pen and paper game played from the perspective of crewmen in armored fighting vehicles. In any era from early war light tanks of WWII to mobile anti-air platforms in a "Cold War Gone Hot" scenario, Knocked Out supports it. Players will take a platoon or company of AFVs through a campaign of missions where events and encounters are all randomly generated, creating a different story with every play-through. A focus on complex, detailed results prevents the fiery action from becoming repetitive. With every roll of the dice lies a new tree of possibilities. The system can be played solitaire or with a group of friends, each controlling their own AFV and a Game Master controlling the flow of the campaign.</p>
                <h2>How RNG(Random Number Generation) is Used</h2>
                <p>A key component of the game as previously stated, is random and procedural generation. Missions and enemies included will all be randomly generated, with the option to generate even more things such as your own platoon’s force composition. A platoon of Sherman tanks most likely did not all have Easy Eights. Maybe one tank is an E8, while the rest are regular Shermans. Or in a Russian T34 platoon, you might get one T-34-85, and 2 T-34/76’s. One might be the 1941 model, one might be the 1943 model. Of course these sorts of compositions depending on a LOT of things beyond just general availability and production times, such as company/division/battalion location, prestige, urgency, ass-kissing, supply line strength, etc. In reality once the T-34/85 and further down the road, IS-2, really came into mass production, mostly everyone had it. It's a little more fun with a more varied composition however, and again, adds some story elements, like for example, this platoon kept it's first tank all this time as a lucky charm.</p>
                <p>Random dice rolls are used to generate almost everything about each mission, which you will see in the user scenario, the crew you get, the type of mission you will embark on for the day, where it takes place, what the enemy composition will consist of, etc. Pretty much everything that isn't of your control is randomly determined.</p>
                <h2>Perspective</h2>
                <p>Also stated previously, is the inner-crew focus of the game. Combat in relation to your own vehicle and crew is incredibly detailed and brutal, as is their perspective of it. Damage to enemy or other allied systems will be far more simpler as your crew surely won’t so easily see the extent of the damage to others. For example, when your AFV is hit by a round, lots of rolls are thrown to determine exactly what systems it destroys if it even pens the armor at all, who it might kill, and other various things. When you shoot at an enemy, it's a simple armor pen check, and then a simple kill check, as is all the crew would see.</p>
                <p>Nation wise, Era wise, the system should be able to really cover anything as long as stats and rules are built out or home-brewed for them. For the prototype I had to narrow the idea down to WW2, and to the big players of WW2, Mainly USA, Soviet Union, and Germany. With infinite time and power, the other players of WW2, UK/Commonwealth, France, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Poland, China, etc. could be done. Further more, also going beyond World War II.</p>

                <h3>Phase A: Setting Up</h3>
                <p>This first phase consists of picking a theatre, nation, and time period. After that’s narrowed down, you will pick or randomly roll for your AFVs. Then crews are generated and the availability of supplies are determined.</p>
                <h3>Phase B: Garage Duties</h3>
                <p>This is where general management of crew and vehicles takes place, as well as supplies, repairs and upgrades from the outside world. Replacements for both crew and vehicle would also take place here.</p>
                <h3>Phase C: Mission</h3>
                <p>Simple, you generate a mission, and you play that mission.</p>
                <h3>Phase D: Results</h3>
                <p>The results of the mission are analyzed and wrapped up.</p>
                <h3>Phase E: Campaign Advancement</h3>
                <p>Time is moved forward, and big picture aspects are examined and compared to where you stand. After this phase, you return to garage duties and repeat the process from there all over again.</p>

                <h2>What is a Tank</h2>
                <p>Consider the diagram above. When a shell hits a tank, right off the bat it has only two places to technically hit in it's most abstract: The Hull and the Turret. Let’s say it hits the hull. On the hull the next immediate layer would be the Armor, Suspension/Tracks System, or any Personnel, Riders, or Crew not inside. If it hits the Armor, then it could hit the Engine, Radio, Fuel, Internal Crew, Vision systems such as parascopes or gun sights, the Armament itself, Ammo Racks, Controls, Batteries, etc.</p>
                <p>As you can see, the tank is a complicated piece of machinery. The goal in such a small scale focused game is not to simply find out whether a tank has been knocked out or not. But rather to see exactly why is has been knocked out. The audience wants to hear how an enemy shell smashed through the turret and bounced down into an ammo rack and exploded the whole tank.</p>

                <h6>Pzkpfw. V Ausf. G, or "Panther", you can see the clear two main distinctions here between turret (section that houses the gun on top) and hull (bigger section on bottom that holds everything else).</h6>

                <h2>Dice Systems</h2>
                <p>Now a lot of wargames use many, many different systems to randomly determine what happens where. In almost all, but not quite all cases, a die or dice are used. There are also a lot of different types of ways to use dice. Two of them are the most commonly used:</p>
                <h3>Even Chance</h3>
                <p>For example, using 1D6(1 Six Sided Die), 1D10, or 1D20, sometimes even 1D100. These allow you to have as many possibilities as you want, but all possibilities have a completely equal chance of happening. If you wanted to add weight to any options you would have to seat them on more than one side.</p>
                <h3>Bell Curve</h3>
                <p>Bell Curves can be generated by dice by using a system like 2D6 for example. Both dice can roll 1-6, and the results are added together. This way if you think about it, there is only ONE way to get either 2 or 12, but there are several ways to add up to 5, 6 or 7. This means you keep a consistent average, where extreme low or high rolls are less likely to happen, following an average in the bell curve.</p>
                <p>After having played quite a few games and systems using all sorts of different types, I have decided to go with a 2D6 system.</p>
                <p>For more information, Amit Patel has a very nice site that explains game mechanics, and an extremely helpful probability/roll system explanation <a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/articles/probability/damage-rolls.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

                <h2>Mission Types</h2>
                <img src="img/combattime.png" alt="Troops and Sherman Tank moving towards battle">
                <h6>American troops and Sherman tank moving towards battle.</h6>
                <p>The idea was to have a set of simplistic mission types instead of getting overly specific with exact or historical missions, to again, allow the player to generate their own story. There will be six types of missions to be determined by 2D6 with weighting. High rolls would give you harder missions and low rolls would be easier. In general with this game, low rolls are best.</p>
                <h3>Defense</h3>
                <p> Generally easy. Sit there and let them come to you. Generally at an advantage, depending on a held position. Most likely to see them before they see you.</p>
                <h3>Escort</h3>
                <p>Protect those who are less protected in moving to another location.</p>
                <h3>Infantry Support</h3>
                <p>Move with Infantry and assist them with their objectives in combined arms.</p>
                <h3>Tank Hunting</h3>
                <p>Find and eliminate enemy tanks that have been causing trouble. Pretty risky, chances are they will see you first.</p>
                <h3>Assault</h3>
                <p>You are part of a massive push to assault/siege a heavily developed/defensive position. Good luck.</p>
                <h3>Ambush</h3>
                <p>You are ambushed while moving somewhere else. Chances are a few men are going to die.</p>

            <h1>Proposed Deliverables</h1>
            <img src="img/deliverables.png" alt="Image of Rules and Poster">
            <h6>Shots of the living rules and symposium poster.</h6>
            <p>For the prototype, the following deliverables were considered: Core Rulebook, Tank Cards, Web Tutorial, and a Website. As the project went on, this was condensed to the idea of having Rules/Example Play through and Tank Cards. The scope of this project was huge however, and while I had a lot of ideas of things to do and so much more I wanted to cram into the game, there just wasn't enough time, and thus the Tank Cards never fit the prototype and turned the game into this more abstract system of spoken mouth, like Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>The Living Rules</h2>
                <p>The living rules are hosted <a href="https://github.com/deadhandfailsafe/knocked-out">HERE</a> as a live, markdown written document on Github for easy source control and viewability. Any updates I make, can be instantly pushed live.</p>
                <h2>Tank Cards</h2>
                <p>Developing a complex system as this, even in it's simplest form, turned out to be a lot of work that I had underestimated. Following the idea of Patton's Best but even more minimal for easier print/play access, I pretty much wanted the entire game to take place on the player's card that housed a small map, their tank info, and that's it. It also matched the same idea of keeping inner crew perspective, tankers don't have this magic overhead view of the entire battlefield, just what's around them and what's relevant to them.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, movement and aiming with combat arcs were two systems that required far too much design work and development to be able to include in the prototype in time so they had to be cut. Without those two mechanics, the whole point of the map board ceased to exist and then without that there wasn't much point in the tank cards either, so the whole system there was scrapped for now.</p>
                <p>In the end, The rulebook, this process collection, and the user scenario demo were the final deliverables.</p>

            <h6>Soviet Tankers inspect damage to enemy tank</h6>
            <p>As previously stated, I decided to tackle an insanely complex system and while I had a large scope planned to begin with, as time went on it became more obvious that I had to cut the scale back more and more, as a result some core ideas didn’t make the cut.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Movement</h2>
                <p>One of the key components is that I was not able to get down and figure out how to really deal with movement. It currently exists as a simple modifier, but there’s no map to move around on, and no way to really do things such as flanking other units yet.</p>
                <h2>Combat Arcs</h2>
                <p>If each turn is only a certain amount of time, a tank for example would only be able to turn, aim, and fire its main weapon turret to a certain degree within that time period. They also simply serve to tell the user what it can shoot at, or what’s in its view.</p>
                <h2>Stats</h2>
                <p>The goal was to find all the factual data on each vehicle for example, armor thickness for front/side/rear armor in mm, and then create a scale based on those numbers and turn them into simpler reduced numbers in the same proportional scale. Time canceled this scope and instead the vehicle stats were borrowed from ASL.</p>
                <h2>Tank Cards</h2>
                <p>While somewhat finished, the concept of how to use them and what sort of game board to use, or to even use a board at all is a constant debate in the prototype.</p>

                    <p>For this user scenario I decided to try my hand at running a platoon of Soviet light tanks, the BT series. It's an Eastern Front conflict, playing as Soviet Russia, and it's Early War. Without a random vehicle generator yet, I decided to give myself two BT-5 tanks led by a command BT-7 tank. I collect the stats into neat little sections as seen to the side here and randomly generate the crews. Based on the results, I can see that overall the selection is pretty average, however a poor commander in the lead tank might be an issue down the road, having rolled an (11) for his position. As you can see, everyone else though, managed to roll average or better with 3,4,6 and 7 roll results.</p>
                    <p>Next up was to determine the availability of supplies, and as shown, I rolled a 3, which is very good and gives me Full supply availability at this point of the campaign.</p>

                    <p>As this is the first instance being run, there's no garage duties to be done, so phase B is skipped and we go straight into the first mission.</p>
                    <p>Rolling an 8 on the mission type, and rolling a 5 for the locale, it is procedurally determined that we are going on a tank hunting mission inside of a city.</p>
                    <p>As the current version doesn't support fully randomly determining the enemy composition, I decided to pit my BT platoon against a German StuG IIIB Siege AFV. The StuG has an Armor Factor of 6 on the front, and 3 on the side, with a 75mm Main Armament. In comparison to my BT platoon which consists of light tanks with only a frontal and side armor rating of 2 and 1 respectively, as well as only 45mm Guns, this is going to be a very grueling match, and it doesn't look good for my platoon.</p>

                    <h3>A Bad Start</h3>
                    <p>With my BT platoon entering and prowling through the desolate and seemingly abandoned city they have been directed towards, the StuG gets a first turn as it lies in wait, and fires at the lead tank, my BT-7. At close range it really needs anything below a 12 to hit which is easily achievable. However the BT tanks present a small target and thus modify his chance to hit by +1, as well as being in the state of moving adding another +1, so now the StuG needs a 10 or below to hit. The roll however was a 4 which with the +2 total modifier ended up being 6. 6 is well below 10, and thus, the StuG's 75mm shell hits the lead BT-7 tank.</p>
                    <p>With the current prototype, only a 50/50 roll is used to determine if a round hits the hull or turret, which in the future would be skewed based on actual size proportions, however it works here well enough. With a 6, the hull is hit.</p>
                    <p>Against the frontal armor rating of the BT-7, 2, and the 75mm gun warranting a To Kill number of 10 on the Armor Pen chart, the armor reducing that to 8, so for the round to penetrate the armor and cause damage, it needs to roll 8 or below.</p>
                    <p>The roll is 7, so the round penetrates. Now in this user scenario I tried two possible mechanic tests of AFV damage. I decided with this first one that for any round that penetrates the vehicle, every single system would basically take a check, rolling to beat that same TK# of 8. If they rolled lower, it was destroyed. I figured after the results this was far too overblown and inaccurate and tried something else later.</p>
                    <p>Either way, with this, the Engine, Radio, all 3 Crew Members, Vision Systems, Armament, Armament Ammo, Ammo, Controls, and Auxiliary Armament were destroyed. Basically the overkilling shell pretty much ripped my light tank apart like a black hole as it zipped through the hull, and suffice to say, the entire tank is out of action as well as all crew being killed. A final check is made on the ammo hit to determine if the ammo will detonate, with a 5, it does not. For it to detonate, you roll 1D6 and it will detonate on a 6. With detonation comes complete destruction without chance of salvation to all components and crew.</p>
                    <p>At the end of Enemy Turn 1, Only two of my tanks remain.</p>

                    <h3>A Worse Progression</h3>
                    <p>Now it's my turn. My two remaining BT-5's do not have sight of the StuG and have to try and scout for it. With the first tank rolling a 6, he can't seem to find it. The second tank does with a 3. Because #2 did see him but #1 did not, he can try to use his commander skill to radio to #1 the position of it, allowing them to try and look again with a bonus. Unfortunately with a 5, and the -1 modifier, he still can not find it. This forfeits the rest of his turn but he can't see anything anyways. #2 on the other hand now decides to try and shoot back at the StuG which he misses with a roll of 12, +1 for being in a state of movement.</p>
                    <p>Enemy Turn 2, The StuG aims at #2 that just fired at him, and fires with a roll of 9, hitting the target. The shot is determined to hit the turret which has an frontal armor rating of 1, being weaker than the hull with 2. The TK# in this instance needed is a 9, and with a roll of 6 the turret is penetrated. This is where I tried my second, and far better damage mechanic. Since the round beat the pen number by 3, 3 systems are randomly determined to be destroyed. By going through the tree and randomly rolling, which resulted in the Controls for the Turret, Radio, and Turret Movement Mechanism itself all being destroyed. Now if they need to turn the turret, the whole tank needs to turn as the turret can no longer turn independently.</p>
                    <p>Another thing to note, in a more full featured game, there would be elevation, which this turret would now also be unable to adjust for, leading to many more problems if the target wasn't on the same elevation at all.</p>
                    <p>Since components or crew was damaged/killed, a shock check is made. A simple 50/50 1-3 = Not Shocked, 4-6 = Shocked with commander modifier used to assist. With a roll of 6, and a commander modifier of 0 from being average, the crew of BT-5 #2 is shocked and their next turn is skipped.</p>
                    <h3>Asking for Revenge</h3>
                    <p>My Turn #2, BT-5 #2 is shocked, so only #1 can activate. A scout check is made and with a roll of 2, the StuG is finally spotted by #1, which they fire at. Unfortunately with a roll of 12(+1) again, they miss.</p>

                    <p>Luckily indeed, on Enemy Turn 3, the StuG misses it's second shot at the previous target.</p>
                    <p>Player Turn #3, #2 recovers, and both BT-5's fire at the StuG, yet both miss.</p>
                    <h3>The End</h3>
                    <p>Enemy Turn #4, the StuG attempts to finish off #2. He scores a hit with a roll of 4, and the round hits the turret again. With a further roll of 4, the round penetrates the armor this time by a difference of 5. The Main Gun, and it's loaded round, as well as the Commander and Gunner are killed, along with their vision systems all destroyed. On a ammo detonation check, a 6 is rolled and the round that was loaded in the main gun cooks off and explodes, further detonating the rest of the explosive materials inside and the entire tank blows apart in a ball of fire.</p>
                    <p>One tank left.</p>
                    <p>As a final survivor, a morale check(same as shock) is made in the last tank, with a 5 they attempt to retreat their vehicle. A 6 is rolled for the retreat attempt, meaning they backed it over something incorrectly or somehow jammed the tank, with it now stuck in place they have to make a bail check under a forced bail. With a 3 the bail is successful and they safely manage to run from the battle.</p>
                    <p>As a final result, all 3 tanks have been knocked out, and only one crew survived.</p>
                    <p>What a failure, but a fun one at that.</p>
